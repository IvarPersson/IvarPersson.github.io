title: "NLDL Winter School"
---

Today marks the final of the Northern Lights Deep Learning (NLDL) Conference in Troms√∂, organised by the Artic University of Norway. A part from the conference itself I have also participated in the adjoining winter school, consisting of various presentations from different experts in their respective fields. Now, the homework waits before the school concludes.

The weather was cloudy the entire week, however the last night the weather cleared and we got to see the northern lights, majestic!
